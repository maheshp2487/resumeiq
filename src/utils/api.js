- Quote or paraphrase specifics from the resume/JD (technologies, role titles, project names if present). Never invent employers, degrees, or years not in the text.
- Weak, thin, or student resumes MUST yield LOW atsScore/techSkillMatch (typically 25–55) and MORE items in weakAreas; do NOT praise thin content.
- Strong, experienced resumes with metrics may score HIGH (75–92).
- If the resume claims cloud/DevOps but JD or context expects AWS/K8s and those are absent, lower techSkillMatch and list them in missingSkills.
- If React/Tailwind (or similar) appear in JD but not resume, lower matchScore and mention explicitly.
- Each tool must produce DISTINCT strengths, weakAreas, and suggestions — do not reuse the same phrases across tools.
- hiringConfidence must align with scores (High only if evidence is strong).

TOOL: ATS Resume Checker ONLY.
- atsScore = ATS compatibility / machine readability (sections, plain bullets, keyword spread, likely parsing issues). NOT overall writing quality.
- techSkillMatch = how well role-relevant keywords appear in parseable form (density + placement), not personality.
- matchScore: if no JD, set matchScore close to atsScore OR a neutral 45–60; if JD present, align keyword overlap.
- strengths: ATS positives (clear headings, standard section names, keyword coverage, simple layout).
- weakAreas: parsing risks (tables, multi-column, icons, dense headers, tiny fonts implied by structure, missing standard sections).
- suggestions: concrete ATS fixes (single column, standard headings, paste-friendly bullets, keyword clusters).
- keywords: missing ATS-relevant tokens inferred from resume+JD (skills/tools).
- summary: focus on ATS pass probability, not storytelling.

${context}`

  if (tool.includes('resume-analyzer')) {

TOOL: Resume Analyzer ONLY (quality of content & story).
- atsScore = overall resume quality / impact (use this as the main quality score for this tool).
- techSkillMatch = strength of technical proof (projects, tools, measurable outcomes).
- matchScore: without JD estimate market readiness from resume alone (40–85); with JD use overlap.
- strengths: impact statements, clarity, project depth, metrics, progression (only if supported by text).
- weakAreas: vague bullets, no metrics, weak verbs, thin projects, formatting of content (not ATS parsing).
- suggestions: rewrite bullets, quantify, reorder sections, strengthen projects.
- keywords: skills that should appear or are under-emphasized based on resume target.

${context}`
  }

  if (tool.includes('jd-match')) {
    return `${antiGeneric}

TOOL: JD Match ONLY (alignment resume vs JD).
- matchScore = percentage fit with JD (must-haves, tools, domain). Primary score for evaluation.
- atsScore = supporting signal: resume strength as presented (can diverge from matchScore).
- techSkillMatch = overlap on technical stack between resume and JD.
- strengths: matched requirements, tools, and themes with evidence.
- missingSkills: JD requirements NOT clearly demonstrated in resume (be explicit: e.g. "AWS (mentioned in JD, not in resume)").
- weakAreas: gaps in responsibilities, domain, seniority mismatch.
- suggestions: targeted edits to mirror JD language (without fabrication).
- keywords: high-value JD terms absent or weak in resume.

${context}`
  }

  if (tool.includes('skill-gap')) {
    return `${antiGeneric}

TOOL: Skill Gap ONLY (learning path toward the role in JD).
- missingSkills: prioritized list (must-learn vs should-learn) from JD vs resume.
- techSkillMatch = how much of the required stack is already demonstrated.
- matchScore = role readiness estimate from gap size (lower = more gaps).
- atsScore = optional baseline resume strength; keep lower if resume is thin.
- strengths: skills already evidenced.
- weakAreas: missing evidence for critical JD skills; interview risk areas.
- suggestions: learning roadmap (courses/projects) + how to add proof to resume.
- summary: readiness narrative and fastest path to credible proof.

${context}`
  }

  if (tool.includes('improvements')) {
    return `${antiGeneric}

TOOL: Resume Improvements ONLY (actionable edits).
- suggestions: numbered-quality rewrites — each must reference something in the resume (section/bullet/skills).
- weakAreas: editorial problems (passive voice, redundancy, weak hooks).
- strengths: what to keep while editing.
- atsScore = potential uplift after fixes (honest: weak resume → low 30s–50s until rewritten).
- techSkillMatch = how compelling tech proof is today.
- matchScore: if no JD, omit alignment focus; mirror atsScore or set 50–70 neutral band.

${context}`
  }

  if (tool.includes('score-checker')) {
    return `${antiGeneric}

TOOL: Resume Score Checker ONLY (weighted rubric).
- Treat atsScore as FINAL weighted overall employability score (clarity 20%, impact 25%, skills evidence 25%, structure 15%, credibility 15% — approximate mentally).
- In summary, briefly justify the weighting in plain language (no tables).
- techSkillMatch = technical evidence sub-score feel converted to 0–100.
- matchScore: without JD mirror overall; with JD add alignment component.
- weakAreas: category-specific misses.
- strengths: category-specific wins.
- suggestions: what moves the score most per category.
